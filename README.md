# Grouptivity - Mobile Directory

**Grouptivity** is a mobile application designed as a corporate directory to help users easily find and contact their colleagues. The app also features a customizable space where users can add various utility widgets for a more personalized experience. We developed it as a four-person collaboration in **September 2023**.

**Note:** This project is no longer maintained, and you may encounter issues while using it.

## Technologies

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) + [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI (installed globally via `npm install -g expo-cli`)
